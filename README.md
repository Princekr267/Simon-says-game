## 🎯 About The Game

Simon Says is an interactive memory game where players must remember and repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colored buttons. Built from scratch as a JavaScript learning project, this game challenges your memory while demonstrating core programming concepts.

**How to Play:**
1. Press any key to start
2. Watch the color sequence flash
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in order
4. Each level adds one more color to remember
5. One mistake ends the game with a red flash

## 💡 What I Learned

Building this game helped me understand several important JavaScript concepts:

- **Event Listeners** - Handling keyboard input and button clicks
- **setTimeout()** - Creating timed animations and sequences
- **Random Number Generation** - Generating random color patterns
- **Game State Management** - Tracking current level, score, and game status
- **DOM Manipulation** - Using `insertAdjacentElement()` and `setAttribute()`
- **Arrays** - Storing and comparing color sequences
- **Conditional Logic** - Game flow control and win/lose conditions
